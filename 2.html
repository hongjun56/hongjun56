<h2>><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gochujang" target="_blank" title="고추장">chili paste</a></h2>
<p>Gochujang or red chili paste[2] is a savory, sweet, and spicy fermented condiment made from chili powder, glutinous rice, meju (fermented soybean) powder, yeotgireum (barley malt powder), and salt.
 The sweetness comes from the starch of cooked glutinous rice, cultured with saccharifying enzymes during the fermentation process.
[3] Traditionally, it has been naturally fermented over years in jangdok (earthenware) on an elevated stone platform, called jangdokdae, in the backyard.</p>
