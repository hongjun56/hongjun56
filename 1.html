<h2>><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doenjang" target="_blank" title="된장">soybeanpaste</a></h2>
<p>a type of <strong><u>fermented bean</u> paste</strong> ma de entirely of soybean and brine.</p>
<p>It is also a byproduct of soup soy sauce production. It is sometimes used as a relish.</p>

<p>Though doenjang and ganjang are usually made together, doenjang can also be made without producing any filtrate.</p>

<p>Tojang (Korean: 토장) – When the aged brine is boiled to become ganjang, the rest (aged meju chunks) are mashed to become tojang.
Jangjae (Korean: 장재) – Smaller amount of brine is used from the beginning. No soy sauce is produced in the process, and the meju aged with the smaller amount of brine becomes jangjae, another type of doenjang.
While traditional doenjang is made with soybeans and brine only, many factory-made variants of doenjang contain a fair amount of wheat flour just like most factory-made soy sauce does. Some current makers also add fermented, dried, and ground anchovies to accentuate doenjang's savory flavor. Korean Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's Food Code classifies doenjang into three categories by their ingredients.[10][11]</p>

<p style="margin-top:40px;">Hansik-doenjang (Korean: 한식된장, "Korean-style fermented soybean paste") – doenjang made with traditional style meju nd brine.
Doenjang (Korean: 된장, "fermented soybean paste") – doenjang made with non-traditional meju (which can be made of soybean, rice, barley, wheat or degreased soybean, and ripened using traditional method or Aspergillus) and saline solution.
Seasoned doenjang (Korean: 조미된장) – product that contains more than 90% of doenjang or hansik-doenjang.</p>
